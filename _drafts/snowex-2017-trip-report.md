[SnowEx](https://snow.nasa.gov/snowex) is a five-year NASA effort that seeks to answer the question:

> How much water is stored in Earthâ€™s terrestrial snow-covered regions?

SnowEx includes multiple aircraft flying a wide suite of sensors along with a significant ground campaign.
SnowEx 2017 is operating in two locations in southwestern Colorado, Grand Mesa near Grand Junction and the Senator Beck basin near Silverton.
I was tasked as part of the team at Senator Beck along with Dr. Jeffery Deems of the National Snow and Ice Data Center and the University of Colorado, Boulder.
Our goal was to use a terrestrial LiDAR scanning (TLS) system to collect snow depths throughout the basin.

Senator Beck basin contains [two study plots and a stream gauge](http://www.snowstudies.org/sbbsa1.html) installed and maintained by the [Center for Snow and Avalanche Studies](http://www.snowstudies.org), operational since about 2003.
This instrumentation provides good hydrologic monitoring for the basin system, making it well-suited for complementary studies.

## Schedule

SnowEx teams were active in Senator Beck during weeks one and three, i.e. February 5-12 and 19-26.
During week two, some reasearchers headed up to Grand Mesa to assist work there, while others headed home.

Signifcant falling or blowing snow limits the effectiveness of the LiDAR system, and so some days we were unable to scan at all; on these days, we supported the SnowEx effort by measuing depth transects and assisting in other field data collection.
In total, we collected five days of TLS data, two during week one and three during week three.
Because travel to the upper basin and the Senator Beck Study Plot (SBSP) takes a significant amount of time, each day of TLS collection either focused on the upper basin or on the Swamp Angel area, and we were able to get two scan days in the upper basin and three at Swamp Angel.

## Collection strategy

We wanted to fulfil the following objectives when designing our collects, which are listed roughly in priority order:

1. Intra-scan consistency, i.e. scans collected the same day should have minimal error in overlaping regions.
2. Absolute accuracy of scan data.
3. Similar data coverage to snow-free TLS scans conducted in September 2016.

We used four 10cm cylyndrical reflectors mounted on bipod-stabalized range poles for registration.
Each reflector (with one exception) was surveyed with a Trimble R10 GNSS receiver, opering in post-processed kinematic (PPK) mode, with a five-minute static collection when mounted on top of the reflector:

We would set up most reflectors in positions that were visible from more than one scan position, and when a reflector was no longer visible, we would move it "forward" to a new position.
