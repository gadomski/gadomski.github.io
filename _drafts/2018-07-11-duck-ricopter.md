In June 2017 we participated in a assessment of unmanned aerial systems (UAS) for flood risk management at the US Army Corps of Engineers Field Research Facility (FRF) in Duck, North Carolina.
We brought our Riegl RiCOPTER with a onboard VUX LiDAR scanner and two RGB cameras.
Here's a picture of our system in the air (with a terrestrial scanner on a tripod on the beach):

The most interesting part of the operation, from a science/research perspective, was the dense network of three-dimensional control points located in the study area.
These control points allowed us to do a robust analysis of our system's accuracy and precision, and will enable us to compare our LiDAR data with coincident photogrammetric surveys.
