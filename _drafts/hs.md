For the past several years we've been using terrestrial LiDAR to monitor snow-covered mountainsides for avalanche stability and mitigation {% cite Deems2015 deems2015ground %}.
We've even gotten some [local press](http://www.dailycamera.com/science_environment/ci_30756446/boulder-scientist-targets-more-effective-safer-avalanche-mitigation).
This post walks through the technical side of the data processing, from georegistration to final height of snow (HS) and change of height of snow (dHS) products.
We'll focus on our scans of the Seven Sisters at Loveland Pass, CO, where we've been working with the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) to assess the effectivity of their installed [GasEx](https://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/18/colorado-mountain-passes-get-remote-controlled-gas-avalanche-control-finally/) systems.
