## U.S. House

## Governor

## State ballot measures

### Amendment V: Lower Age Requirement for Members of the State Legislature [yes]

**Yes**.
If you don't think the person is experienced enough, don't vote for them.

### Amendment W: Election Ballot Format for Judicial Retention Elections [abstain]

**Abstain**.
It's ridiculous that ballot formatting is a state constitutional issue.

### Amendment X: Industrial Hemp Definition [yes]

**Yes**.
When the phrase "delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration that does not exceed three-tenths percent on a dry weight basis" appears in your constitution, you're Doing It Wrongâ„¢.
Constitutions are for broad strokes; technical definitions should be left up to legislatures and/or regulators.

### Amendment Y: Congressional Redistricting [yes]

**Yes**.
[Gerrymandering is a hard problem to solve](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/hating-gerrymandering-is-easy-fixing-it-is-harder/).
Amendments Y and Z are two-of-a-piece that will transfer redistricting control from the legislature to an independent commission(s).
It's got [bipartisan support](https://www.coloradoindependent.com/2018/05/17/voters-in-november-will-decide-whether-colorado-should-drastically-change-the-way-it-draws-political-lines/) and the only opposition I can find is [some dude who's already managed to invoke Godwin's Law](http://13issues.com/Welcome).
I can't really find a credible case why the legislature should maintain control over the process, and though I'm always wary of yet another commission (a.k.a. Moar Gubments), I do think that redistricting is an important enough issue be worth it.

### Amendment Z: Legislative Redistricting [yes]

**Yes**.
See above.

### Amendment A: Prohibit Slavery and Involuntary Servitude in All Circumstances [yes]

**Yes**.
[I was for it in 2016](https://www.facebook.com/pete.gadomski/posts/1132537846842585) and I'm for it now.

### Amendment 73: Funding for Public Schools

This one feels a little weird to me.
It increases revenue, but only guarantees that that increased revenue will be used for education as long as the legislature _doesn't_ pass a new education funding act.
As soon as they pass a new education funding law, the money raised by this amendment could be sent somewhere else (i.e. not education).

I'm all for soaking the rich to get more money for schools, but I smell a rat.

### Amendment 74: Compensation for Reduction in Fair Market Value by Government Law or Regulation

### Amendment 75: Campaign Contributions

### Proposition 109: Authorize Bonds for Highway Projects

### Proposition 110: Authorize Sales Tax and Bonds for Transportation Projects

### Proposition 111: Limitations on Payday Loans

### Proposition 112: Increased Setback Requirement for Oil and Natural Gas Development
