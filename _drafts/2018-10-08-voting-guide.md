## Introduction
{:.no_toc}

Welcome to my 2018 voting guide!

When I lived in Redding, CA, my buddy and I used to get together before every election and talk through the California ballot.
If you've ever lived in California, you know how long that can take, and how freakin' obscure some of the direct democracy proposals can be.
Apparently I _love_ direct democracy, becuase I now live in a similar system in Colorado, which means that there's TEN MILLION propositions and amendments every election cycle (especially in even years).

My buddy and I no longer live in the same state, so I've taken to writing up my thoughts and posting them to the internets.
Here's my past years':

- [2016 (facebook)](https://www.facebook.com/pete.gadomski/posts/1132537846842585)

I post this stuff in the spirit of thoughtful contemplation of issues and a general enthusiasm for engagement.
I don't think these are the only ways to vote, and my general rule is it's better to care, even if you come to a different conclusion than I do.

Note that I live in Longmont, Colorado, so some of the local issues may not be applicable for you.

## U.S. House Colorado District 4 [Karen McCormick]

I live in a [solidly Republican](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2018-midterm-election-forecast/house/colorado/4/) house congressional district currently represented by Ken Buck, who comes off (at least to me) as a Central Casting rural-district Republican (lots of identity and culture war politics, with the usual dose of tax cuts and unwillingness to fund social programs).
He's running to hold his seat, and no one really thinks the challenger, Karen McCormick, has a chance.

I'm going to be honest, I didn't know much about Buck (or McCormick) before writing this post.
As of this writing, neither Buck no McCormick has responded to the [Denver Post's Q&As](https://www.denverpost.com/2018/10/10/colorado-election-2018-candidate-questionnaires/#us-house).
Cursory research on Buck turns up the fact that he thinks [planning for sea level rise helps ISIS](https://buck.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/ken-buck-amendment-refocuses-military-real-enemies), endorsed Ted Cruz and President Trump, and [thinks having a baby is like having cancer (?!?)](https://www.denverpost.com/2014/01/16/ken-buck-under-fire-even-from-gop-rival-for-abortion-remark/).
McCormick seems to be a [traditional Democrat in these times](http://www.cpr.org/news/story/2018-election-cd4-ken-buck-and-karen-mccormick-on-the-issues), though I'm not stoked how hard it is to find interviews and such with her.
But given Buck's self-professed positions on common-sense issues (have humans contributed to climate change and should we spend resources to help mitigate its impacts? is [being gay like being an alcoholic](https://www.denverpost.com/2010/10/17/bucks-remarks-on-homosexuality-loom-after-meet-the-press-debate/)?) there's no choice but McCormick.

## Governor

## State ballot measures

### Amendment V: Lower Age Requirement for Members of the State Legislature [yes]

**Yes**.
If you don't think the person is experienced enough, don't vote for them.

### Amendment W: Election Ballot Format for Judicial Retention Elections [abstain]

**Abstain**.
It's ridiculous that ballot formatting is a state constitutional issue.

### Amendment X: Industrial Hemp Definition [yes]

**Yes**.
When the phrase "delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration that does not exceed three-tenths percent on a dry weight basis" appears in your constitution, you're Doing It Wrongâ„¢.
Constitutions are for broad strokes; technical definitions should be left up to legislatures and/or regulators.

### Amendment Y: Congressional Redistricting [yes]

**Yes**.
[Gerrymandering is a hard problem to solve](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/hating-gerrymandering-is-easy-fixing-it-is-harder/).
Amendments Y and Z are two-of-a-piece that will transfer redistricting control from the legislature to an independent commission(s).
It's got [bipartisan support](https://www.coloradoindependent.com/2018/05/17/voters-in-november-will-decide-whether-colorado-should-drastically-change-the-way-it-draws-political-lines/) and the only opposition I can find is [some dude who's already managed to invoke Godwin's Law](http://13issues.com/Welcome).
I can't really find a credible case why the legislature should maintain control over the process, and though I'm always wary of yet another commission (a.k.a. Moar Gubments), I do think that redistricting is an important enough issue be worth it.

### Amendment Z: Legislative Redistricting [yes]

**Yes**.
See above.

### Amendment A: Prohibit Slavery and Involuntary Servitude in All Circumstances [yes]

**Yes**.
[I was for it in 2016](https://www.facebook.com/pete.gadomski/posts/1132537846842585) and I'm for it now.

### Amendment 73: Funding for Public Schools

This one feels a little weird to me.
It increases revenue, but only guarantees that that increased revenue will be used for education as long as the legislature _doesn't_ pass a new education funding act.
As soon as they pass a new education funding law, the money raised by this amendment could be sent somewhere else (i.e. not education).

I'm all for soaking the rich to get more money for schools, but I smell a rat.

### Amendment 74: Compensation for Reduction in Fair Market Value by Government Law or Regulation

### Amendment 75: Campaign Contributions

### Proposition 109: Authorize Bonds for Highway Projects

### Proposition 110: Authorize Sales Tax and Bonds for Transportation Projects

### Proposition 111: Limitations on Payday Loans

### Proposition 112: Increased Setback Requirement for Oil and Natural Gas Development
