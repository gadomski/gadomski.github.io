title: 2018 Republican primary voting guide

## House district 4

Ken Buck:

- Unconstitutionally raided a tax service in Greely looking for social security numbers that had been stolen by illegal immigrants.
- Once said that he should get votes because he "didn't wear high heels" like his opponent.
- Climate denier
- Links prenatal parental alcoholism with being gay (?!?)

Needless to say, not casting a vote in this one.

## Governer

Walker Stapleton:

- Fights against "sanctuary cities"
- Supports charters
- Trying to be Trumpy

Greg Lopenz:

- Called Trump a "good role model"
- Only climate change denier

Doug Robinson:

- The only one to stand up to child seperation at the border.
- Praised the tax cuts (meh) but doesn't like the trade policies

Victor Mitchell:

- Supported third party over Trump
- Thinks the president is on the "right track" on immagration reform
- Doesn't like Trump's trade policies

Looks like Doug Robinson

## Treasurer

Justin Everett:

- Never Trumper
- Seems like your classic fiscal responsibility repblican

Polly Lawrence:

- Trumper

Brian Watson:

- Hard to find much
