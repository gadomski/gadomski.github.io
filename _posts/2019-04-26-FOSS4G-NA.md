![The title slide of my FOSS4GNA talk.](/img/2019-04-26-foss4gna-title-slide.png)

Whelp, looks like it's been a year since I've updated this www.gadom.ski, since my last post was about FOSS4G-NA 2018.

This year I talked about calulating snow depths with [PDAL](https://pdal.io/), essentialy a "methods of doing The Science" talk.
I did a compare-and-contrast between a couple of different methods of calculating snow depths, and showed how you can extend PDAL's functionality with Python and by hacking on the codebase yourself.
The slides are available for download as a Powerpoint [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3ua5qqq4j1ge250/2019-04-16-SnowDepthsPDAL.pptx?dl=0) (it's big b/c lots of movies).

I enjoyed the conference, particularly because once I made it to my hotel I never got in a car -- bike/scooter share in San Diego FTW.
Also the beer was very good, and I may or may not have snuck of Wednesday afternoon to watch that incredible Man City v. Tottenham Champions League game.
Good times.
