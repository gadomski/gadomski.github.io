I'm happy to announce the release of [cpd v0.5.0](https://github.com/gadomski/cpd/releases/tag/v0.5.0), as well as the associated [PDAL plugin update](https://github.com/PDAL/PDAL/pull/1474).
**cpd** is a C++ library I have developed for running the [Coherent Point Drift](https://sites.google.com/site/myronenko/research/cpd) (CPD) point cloud change detection algorithm.

One of my research areas is whether CPD is a viable tool for point cloud change detection and registration as compared to existing methods. 
One place where I've used **cpd** is with repeat LiDAR scans to measure glacier velocity, e.g. at the Helheim Glacier in southeast Greenland:

There's a lot of space and work to be done with CPD, and at this point I'm just scratching that ol' surface.
But the **cpd** codebase is reaching, if not maturity, then the equivalent of its early twenties, so I'm hopeful that I will be able to slow down on direct development and focus more on applications and downstream science.

The PDAL plugin in pretty limited, and it this point exists mostly as a proof-of-concept. 
Rather than use it directly, I usually create a new project (e.g. [hunky-dory](https://github.com/gadomski/hunky-dory)) for a specific use-case.
However, the plan is to eventually roll all of my external change detection projects back into PDAL once my tools mature enough that I won't be over-churning the PDAL codebase.
At that point, the PDAL **cpd** plugin should become more powerful; it might even evolve into a higher-level **changes** plugin that can run multiple change detection algorithms, e.g. [ICP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_closest_point).
Stay tuned.
