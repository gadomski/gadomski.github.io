I presented a poster at [the AGU 2017 fall meeting](https://fallmeeting.agu.org/2017/program-overview/).
The long-winded title was "Three summer of high-resolution, high-accuracy velocity data of Helheim Glacier, as measured by an automated terrestrial LiDAR scanner: methods, challenges, and applications."
If you want to look at the PDF version of the poster, I have it [here](/pdf/2017-AGU-Gadomski-Poster.pdf).

A few quick things I learned while making this thing:

1. [GMT](http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/) is The Jam.
   As a part of this work, I had to create a velocity map for each dimension for each pair of scans, i.e. over two thousand maps.
   Totally undoable with a point-and-click GIS.
   GMT scripted everything and let me update my map styles by changing a script and running make.
2. [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) is some good stuff as well.
   I'm using it to make movies out of those maps.
   I have a couple of tweaks to make before I want to publish anything, but standby for those movies, they're a good way to visualize what's going on.
3. Even though the AGU site says that their poster boards are 6' x 4', they're not.
   Make a 5' x 4' or 5' x 3 poster if you don't want to look like a giant goober.
4. I'm still not totally sold on [goofys](https://github.com/kahing/goofys) for working with files in s3 buckets.
   On one hand, it *can* streamline a lot of operations.
   On the other hand, I find that stuff like [gdal](http://www.gdal.org/) can error when trying to write to goofys mounts, forcing an extra tmp-file-then-copy-then-remove step.

All in all, though, it was a great experience and some work I'm actually proud of!
