      <p>I&rsquo;ve created <a href="https://github.com/gadomski/sbd-rs"><strong>sbd-rs</strong></a>, a <a href="https://crates.io/crates/sbd">crate</a> written in <a href="https://crates.io/crates/sbd">Rust</a>; <a href="https://crates.io/crates/las">my first crate</a> was a Rust-native <a href="http://www.asprs.org/Committee-General/LASer-LAS-File-Format-Exchange-Activities.html">las</a> reader, announced on this site <a href="/post/las-rs-announcement">previously</a>.
<strong>sbd-rs</strong> includes a library for reading, decoding, and writing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iridium_Communications#SBD_Modems">Iridium SBD messages</a>, which are used to transmit data from remote climate monitoring stations, among other uses.
It also includes an executable which exposes some of the library&rsquo;s functionality to a system, including a forever-running TCP server that handles incoming Iridium DirectIP communications.
For one example of climate data that is transmitted via Iridium SBD, see the <a href="http://atlas.lidar.io">ATLAS home page</a>.</p>

<p>At risk of making too much of it, I loved my experience developing in Rust for this work.
Like oh-so-many projects, I started <strong>sbd-rs</strong> a while ago (August 28th of this year), did some work, then dropped it until this past week (late October).
This is more than enough time to forget the details of the nitpicky design decisions that you made when creating a library, and in some languages (here&rsquo;s looking at you, any dynamically typed language), enough time to render a mostly-incomplete project useless upon retrieval.
We&rsquo;ve all been there &ndash; coming back to a half-baked idea with no idea what&rsquo;s going on, and deciding to rewrite the damn thing instead of trying to untangle the existing work.
I thought that&rsquo;s what I was going to have to do with this one when I realized I needed to recode <a href="https://github.com/gadomski/sbd">my existing Iridium DirectIP server</a> with quick turnaround.</p>

<p>Before burning my the existing Rust work to the ground, I decided to try and untangle what I&rsquo;d done, just in case.
It turns out that Rust is the most come-back-later-able language I&rsquo;ve run into, and in a very quick window I was able to hack together what I needed.</p>

<p>First, there&rsquo;s the ease of testing.
Testing is built in to the language as a native construct, making the work required to set up some basic sanity testing very light.
This, in turn, makes it much more likely that a half-finished project will have tests, which makes it much more trustable.
I know that my past self <em>sucks</em> at coding and am likely to not trust code he has written &ndash; only with tests can I use any code that he&rsquo;s made at all.</p>

<p>Second, there&rsquo;s the strict yet understandable lints.
One example: I can tell <code>rustc</code> to yell at me when I forget to document a public function, forcing me to at least put a little thought into what I&rsquo;m doing.
Again, since documentation is more or less a first-class entity in rust, this is cheap and easy, rather than all custom-y feeling when doing it in C++ (e.g.).</p>

<p>Third, the standard library.
It has what you need, e.g. a native <code>BufReader</code> that takes a stream of bytes and handles the buffering for you.
Sure, sometimes I want custom buffering behavior, and if so I can write my own, but most of the time I just want to explicitly say that I don&rsquo;t just want to read this stream of bytes, I want to do it all smart-like.
Sometimes it takes a bit to get your head around traits and namespaces, and because Rust is such a new language figuring out the idiomatic way of doing something can take a bit of work, but in general I feel like I get guided in a good direction by the language itself.</p>

<p>Finally, there&rsquo;s the fact that Rust is <em>very</em> opinionated.
The borrow checker makes you think about every single move and every single reference, which I suppose could be a slow-down for some developers.
For me, I don&rsquo;t want to think about the right way to do something, I want the compiler (or better yet, a compiler-aware vim plugin) to tell me when I&rsquo;m wrong.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not perfect.
I would love something like <code>clang-check</code> for rust.
There&rsquo;s the inertia problem of any new language, where it takes work to convince anyone to use it for anything.
But this experience was enough to convince me to use it again on another project.</p>
