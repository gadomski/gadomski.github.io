When you're building a Python library, take care with your dependency specifiers.
Overly-specific or overly-restrictive dependencies can quickly lead to dependency hell for your dependents.
I've written two articles on the topic, the first one in 2022:

- In [Dependency protection with Python and Github actions](@/posts/2022-02-18-dependency-protection-with-python-and-github-actions.md), I outlined a scheme to test minimum versions against a manually-maintained `requirements-min.txt`.
- The follow-on [Dependency protection with pyproject.toml](@/posts/2023-05-10-pyproject-toml.md) "simplified" the workflow with a utility script to calculate and install the minimum versions of dependencies.

All these backflips were required because [pip doesn't support resolving to minimum versions](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/8085).
Various utilities and package management systems did, but none of them felt like the right solution to me â€” until now.

## Just use **uv**

[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) is a Python package and project manager from [Astral](https://astral.sh/), the folks who brought us [ruff](https://astral.sh/ruff).
Astral, in my opinion, are those rare folks whose tools actually live up to their hype.
**uv** does a lot of stuff, including solving our minimum dependency problem.

```sh
uv pip install . --resolution lowest # or --resolution lowest-direct
```

If you're using [**uv** projects](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/) (which I would recommend) you can `sync` to your lowest versions as well:

```sh
uv sync --resolution lowest
```

This makes things pretty darn simple, especially compared to the mess that was the solutions I wrote about above.
To see this in action, I just updated [antimeridian](https://github.com/gadomski/antimeridian/pull/139) to use **uv** in its CI to [test against minimum versions](https://github.com/gadomski/antimeridian/pull/139/files#diff-944291df2c9c06359d37cc8833d182d705c9e8c3108e7cfe132d61a06e9133ddR44-R52):

```yaml
      - uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v3
      - name: Sync
        run: uv sync --resolution lowest-direct
      - name: pytest
        run: uv run pytest
      - name: Sync w/ all extras
        run: uv sync --resolution lowest-direct --all-extras
      - name: pytest
        run: uv run pytest
```
