The [Colorado Trail](https://coloradotrail.org) runs about 490 miles from Denver to Durango.
In July 2025, my wife Kelly and our friend Bex did a unique relay of the trail; Kelly ran the wilderness sections, where bikes are not allowed, and Bex mountain biked the rest.
They carried a [Garmin InReach](https://www.garmin.com/en-US/c/outdoor-recreation/satellite-communicators/) with them, and those of us watching the adventure used the (kinda jankey but serves its purpose) `share.garmin.com` site to follow them when they were out on the trail.

share.garmin.com â€” it's not pretty, but it serves its purpose.
{% end %}

I wanted a way to show their progress through the state[^1], and help folks get a better picture of how the relay worked in a day-to-day sense (who was on the trail, how far they were going, etc).
So I built a site to track their progress, <https://www.gadom.ski/ct-relay/>, and few of the bits of work to build the site seemed interesting enough to share.

I am _so_ not a frontend engineer.

## Source data

The first thing I needed was the Colorado Trail itself, and that proved trickier than expected.
There's plenty of folks' personal GPS tracks out there on the internet, but I wanted to use an "authoritative" source â€” you can't just trust anything you find on the internet, you know what I mean?
After wasting some time on portals[^2] like <https://trails.colorado.gov/>, I found my way to Colorado Parks & Wildlife's (CPW') [ArcGis portal](https://geodata-cpw.hub.arcgis.com/maps/CPW::cpwadmindata/about), and specifically their [COTREX Trails](https://geodata-cpw.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/CPW::cpwadmindata/explore?layer=15&location=39.371713%2C-104.927922%2C10.42) dataset.
Can't get much more authoritative than that!

The GeoJSON feature collection weighs in at 229MB with almost 100k features, and (surprise surprise) there's no single "Colorado Trail" feature.
However, there _are_ many (229) segments in that dataset that include a `Colorado Trail Segment N` name.
A little bit of SQL (via [DuckDB and its excellent spatial extension](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/core_extensions/spatial/overview.html)), a bit of manual cleanup with [QGIS](https://qgis.org/), and I had myself a single line string of the Colorado Trail[^3].

{% figure(src="/img/ct.png", alt="The Colorado Trail") %}
Wow, look, a line.
{% end %}

## Tracking data

Now I needed to overlay their progress on that line.
There's no pretty way to say it â€” I (lightly, legally[^4]) reverse-engineered Garmin's API[^5].
`share.garmin.com` uses a [WebSocket API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API) to ship data for the current viewport to your browser.
To get Kelly and Bex's locations, all I had to do was open up their live tracker, zoom to the day's points, open up [Developer Tools](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/), and grab the latest `UpdateUser` message from the WebSocket connection.
Easy enough, right?[^6]

Neerrrrrrd
{% end %}

## Putting it together

The rest was straightforward â€” if we were living in a different timeline where I actually know how to write frontend code.
The rest was pretty hard but a learned a lot ðŸ¤£.

- The site: <https://www.gadom.ski/ct-relay/>
- The code: <https://github.com/gadomski/ct-relay/>
- Just the Colorado Trail stuff (w/o the relay): <https://github.com/gadomski/colorado-trail>.

[^3]: Eastern Collegiate route, if you were wondering.
[^4]: Maybe?
[^5]: Almost. I didn't quite figure out the sequence of calls to plug their data my own site to use their live updates directly. For now, the process requires a human to grab the data at the end of each day.
[^6]: This sort of cash grab business model, where companies will send you geospatial data but not in a way that's easy to use, drives me bonkers.
