## The problem

Nothing lasts forever.
In the digital age, nothing lasts.

Companies come and go, platforms and services are stood up and then abandoned, and new government administrations [limit access to public data](https://apnews.com/article/cdc-census-federal-data-trump-6a9ba7c01a42b72e2c0a119325ba3753).
When data become available, it's only natural to want to get it and save it, just in case it goes away.

Data duplication isn't just for hoarders.
Commercial companies copy data across continents to enable faster access for nearby customers.
Small, focused stores of data might be useful when you don't want to rely on large, potentially flakey government services for your core business operations (here's to you, NASA [DAACs](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/centers)).

## Tooling

There's a couple tools that help with geospatial data duplication:

1. [STAC](https://stacspec.org): The SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) specification is designed for **search and discovery**.
   Even if a data provider doesn't have a STAC catalog for their data, you can make one yourself to help learn what's there.
2. [obstore](https://developmentseed.org/obstore): Whether it's one of the big three cloud providers in the US, or smaller providers in Europe, **obstore** is a new Python library that is designed to get and put data from all of them.
   **obstore** is built with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) for [high performance](https://github.com/geospatial-jeff/pyasyncio-benchmark/blob/2d8ee4df8c2d93463323394f09fd094ad0381122/test_results/cog_header_results.csv).
3. [stac-geoparquet](https://github.com/stac-utils/stac-geoparquet/blob/main/spec/stac-geoparquet-spec.md): One of the core tenants of [cloud-native geospatial](https://guide.cloudnativegeo.org) is that data at rest should still be useful.
   **stac-geoparquet** is a small specification for putting STAC into [geoparquet](https://geoparquet.org/) files.
   This enables both [compressed storage](https://www.gadom.ski/2025-02-05-PangeoShowcase/#/4) and queryability via [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/).

## Putting it together

I've made a proof-of-concept script at [developmentseed/atd](https://github.com/developmentseed/atd) to demonstrate how you might bring these concepts together to duplicate data quickly and efficiently.
It's annotated source code is available at <http://developmentseed.org/atd/> if you want to check it out.
The script isn't intended for production usage, but more to demonstrate how you might make a duplication pipeline using these modern tools.

## Motivation

This work was motivated by an excellent conversation with our partners during Development Seed Team Week 2025 in Washington, DC.
In response to the question "How do we get away from making unnecessary copies of data?", one partner replied (paraphrasing):

> While we don't always want to duplicate data, we always want to maintain the _ability to duplicate_.

That phrase stuck with me, and here we are.
