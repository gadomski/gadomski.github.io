[stac-rs](https://github.com/stac-utils/stac-rs) is a "hobby" project of mine.
I put "hobby" in quotes because I've sunk quite a few tens (hundreds?) of hours into it because I think it might actually Be Usefulâ„¢ in the real world in the not-to-distant future.
I talked about it at [FOSS4G-NA 2024](@/posts/2024-09-19-FOSS4G-NA.md), and afterwords discovered that [at least one person is using it in production](https://github.com/stac-utils/stac-rs/issues/375#issue-2521984744).
So, I'm happy to announce the v0.10 release of the core crate, [stac](https://crates.io/crates/stac/0.10.0).

## STAC v1.1.0 ðŸŽ‰

[STAC v1.1.0](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/releases/tag/v1.1.0) was released this month, and **stac-rs** is STAC v1.1.0 by default!

```rust
use stac::Item;

let item = Item::new("an-id");
assert_eq!(item.version.to_string(), "1.1.0");
```

You can migrate existing STAC objects from v1.0.0 to v1.1.0:

```rust
use stac::{Item, Migrate, Version};

let mut item: Item = stac::read("item-v1.0.0.json").unwrap();
let item = item.migrate(&Version::v1_1_0).unwrap();
assert_eq!(item.version, Version::v1_1_0);
```

This migration includes moving `raster` and `eo` bands information up to the new `bands` structure, as described in the [best practices](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/blob/master/best-practices.md#band-migration).

## Formats

With the advent of [stac-geoparquet](https://github.com/stac-utils/stac-geoparquet) as a potential[^1] alternative storage format for STAC items, **stac-rs** now supports three [formats](https://docs.rs/stac/0.10.0/stac/enum.Format.html):

- JSON
- Newline-delimited JSON (ndjson)
- stac-geoparquet

Each format provides methods to read and write its data either from a `Read` or a `Write`, or from `Vec<u8>` or `Bytes`:

```rust
use stac::{Item, Format, ItemCollection};

let item: Item = Format::json().from_path("item.json").unwrap();

let items: ItemCollection = Format::geoparquet().from_path("items.parquet").unwrap();
Format::ndjson().write("items.ndjson", items);
```

## Object store

[fsspec](https://filesystem-spec.readthedocs.io) is a widely-used Python library that allows folks to use the same interface to open files from a variety of sources, including the local filesystem and cloud provider blob storage.
[object_store](https://docs.rs/object_store/latest/object_store/) is the Rust equivalent, and **stac** v0.10 includes **object_store** support via some [free functions](https://docs.rs/stac/0.10.0/stac/io/index.html):

```rust
use stac::Item;

let href = "s3://bucket/item.json";
let options = [("aws_access_key_id", "...")];
let item: Item = stac::io::get_opts(href, options).await.unwrap();
stac::io::put_opts(href, item, options).await.unwrap();
```

## Other crates

Along with the **stac** release, we also released:

- [stac-api v0.6.0](https://docs.rs/stac-api/0.6.0/stac_api/index.html), with `Client` and `BlockingClient` for searching APIs
- [stac-validate v0.3.0](https://docs.rs/stac-validate/0.3.0/stac_validate/index.html), with a new async-first API
- [stac-cli v0.4.0](https://crates.io/crates/stac-cli/0.4.0) to provide access to all this new functionality on the command line

## Next steps

Now that I've got the core library updated, I'm going to spend some time on [the Python bindings](https://pypi.org/project/stacrs/).
Specifically, I've implemented (but not released) [a request](https://github.com/stac-utils/stac-rs/issues/374) to add search capabilities to the Python API, particularly to enable writing the search directly to **stac-geoparquet**:

```python
import stacrs

stacrs.search_to(
    "items.parquet",
    "https://landsatlook.usgs.gov/stac-server",
    collections="landsat-c2l2-sr",
    intersects={"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-105.119, 40.173]},
    sortby="-properties.datetime",
    max_items=1,
)
```

I'd like to release that, along with some better documentation on how to use the Python bindings and what alternatives you should use when **stacrs** isn't enough (i.e. [pystac](https://pystac.readthedocs.io) and [pystac-client](https://pystac-client.readthedocs.io)).
I also need to do a write-up of [my FOSS4G-NA 2024 talk](@/posts/2024-09-19-FOSS4G-NA.md) to provide more narrative on how to use the CLI.

## Get in touch

If you're using **stac-rs**, or you'd like to use it, get in touch!
I'm on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/gadom.ski), or ask anything in the [Github Discussions](https://github.com/stac-utils/stac-rs/discussions).
I think that Rust has a interesting, if niche, place to contribute to the geospatial community, both as a component of our shared open source infrastructure and as a performance-boosting layer for downstream data consumers.

[^1]: The community is still figuring out how exactly **stac-geoparquet** will interact with the STAC specification. Some sticky points include the awkwardness of updating existing parquet files, and the additional burden on developers to maintain tooling for multiple formats. See the recent [Cloud Native Geospatial blog post](https://cloudnativegeo.org/blog/2024/08/introduction-to-stac-geoparquet/) for more.
