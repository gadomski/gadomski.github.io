My slides from my 2024 FOSS4G-NA talk, "stac-rs: High-performance, reliable STAC tooling with Rust" are available [here](https://www.gadom.ski/2024-09-FOSS4G-NA-stac-rs/).
One of my favorite parts of preparing the talk was making this little guy:

It took me so much longer than it should have to get the claw+logo layering correct — I Am Not A Graphic Designer, obviously.

Some takeaways from the conference:

- It's really fun being at a conference and _not_ representing a company. I just felt like I could do what I wanted, which I enjoyed.
- I always love this conference, so many folks that I know from the near and distant past.
- There's a lot of chatter about [stac-geoparquet](https://github.com/stac-utils/stac-geoparquet), and my sense is that community isn't quite sure how it will be used, but that it will probably be used.
- I got more than a few questions along the lines of "What's the deal with Rust and geo? Is it useful?" and I probably should write a post just about that, because I have thoughts. Tl;dr: good for making tooling and core components, but if you find yourself scripting you're Doing It Wrong™ (just use Python).
