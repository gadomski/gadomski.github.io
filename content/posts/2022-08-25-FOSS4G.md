On Wednesday morning, I presented "STAC Best Practices and Tools".
The presentation is available above as embedded Google Slides.
The presentation was recorded, and I'll update this post with a link to the video if/when that becomes available.

It's been a _blast_ at FOSS4G so far.
Still have a couple of days and I can't wait.
So good to catch up with so many folks, some of whom I haven't seen in over a decade.
Full report (maybe) to come later.
