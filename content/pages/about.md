Pete Gadomski is an open source geospatial software engineer at [Development Seed](https://developmentseed.org/) living in Longmont, CO.
His focus is on the intersection between commercial and government remote sensing, with a side hobby in building Rust tooling for geospatial.

Previously, Pete was:

- Senior Test Engineer at [Ball Aerospace](https://www.baesystems.com/en-us/our-company/inc-businesses/space-and-mission-systems) "specializing" in RF systems (I say "specializing" because I came in knowing very little, but learned a lot)
